# Player's Gear Primer

This guide details the equipment available to your characters in the grim darkness of the 41st Millennium. It has been updated to align with the core rules of the game, explaining how to acquire and use gear through the Flashback system.

### The Three Tiers of Gear

Equipment is divided into three tiers that determine its availability.

* **ACCESSIBLE:** This is common, unrestricted equipment. You can assume you have any Accessible item that fits the fiction, without needing a roll or spending Momentum. Anyone might carry a knife or wear simple leather armor.
* **INACCESSIBLE:** This is specialized, rare, or restricted equipment. To acquire an Inaccessible item, you must spend **1 Momentum** on a **Flashback**, which must be justified by one of your Traits. Once you flashback to an item, it becomes a permanent part of your kit for future scenes where it makes sense to have it.
* **EPIC:** This is legendary and powerful equipment like Power Armor or a Plasma Gun. Epic gear cannot be acquired through flashbacks. It can only be earned as a reward for completing significant story objectives.

### Acquiring Gear: Trait-Enabled Flashbacks

The most common way to get new gear is to reveal you had it all along. This is a Flashback.

**How It Works:**
1.  **State Your Intent:** "I want to reveal I brought my Chainsword."
2.  **Spend the Momentum:** It costs a flat **1 Momentum** to gain a mechanical benefit, like having a new piece of gear.
3.  **Justify with a Trait:** You must explain how one of your Traits made this preparation possible. Your Trait is your permission slip to have the item.
4.  **Receive the Item:** The gear is now part of your loadout.
