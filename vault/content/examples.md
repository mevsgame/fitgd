# FORGED IN THE GRIMDARK

## PLAY EXAMPLES

These examples illustrate key mechanics in action.

## POSITION & EFFECT NEGOTIATION

**Situation:** The team needs to hack a secured servitor terminal while cultists patrol nearby.
**Maria (Player):** "I want to use Tech to bypass the terminal's cogitator lock."
**GM:** "Okay, let's figure out Position and Effect. The cultists are close, and if you fail they'll hear the alarm - that's Risky Position. The lock is standard Imperial encryption, so Standard Effect - you'll get in, but it'll take time."
**Maria:** "Can I use my Trait 'Former Mechanicus Adept' to improve my Position? I've worked with these systems before."
**GM:** "Absolutely. Your familiarity means you can work quietly and efficiently. That brings you to Controlled Position."
**Maria:** "What about Effect? I have a data-spike that's high quality gear."
**GM:** "Sure, the data-spike means you can crack it faster and maybe pull extra data. That improves to Great Effect."
**Result:** Maria rolls Tech in Controlled Position for Great Effect. She has 2 dots in Tech, so rolls 2d6.

## FLASHBACK WITH TRAIT CREATION

**Situation:** The team is pinned down by heavy fire from a Chaos-corrupted Ogryn. They're at 7 Momentum.
**Kai (Player):** "Wait - before we got here, I spent time in the Guard fighting Orks. I know how to deal with big targets. I flashback to preparing specialized ammo for this mission."
**GM:** "You want to establish a new Trait through this flashback?"
**Kai:** "Yeah - 'Astra Militarum Veteran: Anti-Large Specialist.' It justifies me having krak grenades ready."
**GM:** "Perfect. Spend 1 Momentum. You gain that Trait permanently, and you have krak grenades for this fight. The grenades improve your Effect to Great when attacking the Ogryn."
**Result:** Kai spends 1 Momentum (now at 6), gains the permanent Trait, and has krak grenades. This flashback provided a mechanical advantage (Great Effect) by establishing prior preparation.

## MOMENTUM GENERATION & SPENDING

**Starting:** Team at 5 Momentum. Risky mission to plant explosives in a cultist hideout.
**Action 1 - Skulk (Sofia, 2 dots):** Sofia rolls to sneak past guards. Rolls 2d6: gets a 3 and 5. Partial success (4-5).

- **Result:** She gets past, but the GM says a guard notices something suspicious and will investigate in a moment. Sofia takes a Risky consequence (+2 Momentum). Team now at **7 Momentum**.
  **Action 2 - Push + Wreck (Jax, 1 dot):** Jax needs to plant the explosives quickly before the guard arrives. He Pushes himself for +1d.
- **Spend:** -1 Momentum (team at **6 Momentum**)
- **Roll:** 2d6 (1 dot + 1 from Push): gets 6 and 4. Full success!
- **Result:** Explosives planted, no consequences. No Momentum generated.
  **Action 3 - Desperate Shoot (Sofia, 2 dots):** The suspicious guard finds them. Sofia's Position worsens to Desperate. She rolls Shoot: 2d6, gets 2 and 3. Failure.
- **Result:** She misses and the guard raises the alarm. GM advances a "Cult Alerted" clock by 4 segments (Desperate consequence). Sofia gains +4 Momentum. Team now at **10 Momentum (capped)**.
  **Action 4 - Rally:** Team is discovered but has max Momentum. No need for Rally - they're resource-rich and ready for a big fight.

## RALLY IN DESPERATE TIMES

**Situation:** After a brutal firefight, the team is at 2 Momentum. Two characters are wounded, and they face a final locked door.
**Marcus (Player):** "I initiate a Rally. I flashback to a moment before the mission where Sofia told us about her 'Survivor of Hive Bottom' trait - how she never gives up. That memory inspires me now."
**GM:** "Sofia is present, so that works. Roll whatever Action makes sense for this inspirational flashback - maybe Consort or Command?"
**Marcus:** "Consort - I'm connecting with the team emotionally." 
**GM:** "Controlled Position always for Rally. Roll it."
**Marcus (1 dot in Consort):** Rolls 1d6, gets a 5. Partial success.

- **Result:** +2 Momentum (team now at **4 Momentum**). Marcus also re-enables his own disabled Trait "Oaths of the Ecclesiarchy" which he'd Leaned into earlier.
  **Next Action:** With 4 Momentum, the team has resources to Push their way through the final door.

## GROUP ACTION WITH CONSEQUENCES

**Situation:** Four team members try to barricade a door together while horrors pound on it from the other side. They need to act as one.
**GM:** "This is a Group Action. Who's leading?"
**Tomas:** "I'll lead. I have 3 dots in Wreck."
**GM:** "Everyone make your own Wreck rolls. Tomas's result becomes the group outcome, but he takes 1 harm segment for each teammate who fails."
**Rolls:**

- Tomas (3 dots): 6, 5, 4 = 6 (Full Success!)
- Elena (2 dots): 4, 3 = 4 (Partial)
- Kai (1 dot): 2 (Failure)
- Sofia (2 dots): 6, 6 (Critical!)
  **Result:** The group uses Tomas's result (6 - Full Success). The barricade holds perfectly. However, Tomas takes 1 segment of Physical harm because Kai failed (got 1-3). The GM narrates Kai losing his grip, and Tomas straining to compensate, pulling a muscle.

## TRAIT COMPLICATIONS (LEANING IN)

**Situation:** Team at 8 Momentum, investigating a potential Warp breach. Things seem stable.
**Yuki (Player):** "My character has 'Witnessed the Immaterium' as a Trait. I want to Lean into it - my character's PTSD from that experience makes them paranoid. I insist the team conduct extensive purification rites before entering, slowing us down."
**GM:** "That's a great complication. The delay allows the cultists to fortify their position inside. What was a Controlled assault is now Risky."
**Result:** 

- Team gains +2 Momentum (now at **10, capped**)
- Yuki's "Witnessed the Immaterium" Trait is disabled (checked off)
- The mission gets harder, but the team has resources to handle it
  Later, if the team drops to 0-3 Momentum, someone can Rally and re-enable Yuki's Trait, representing them working through the trauma together.

## HARM PROGRESSION & FIGHTING WOUNDED

**Combat sequence showing harm accumulation:**
**Round 1 - Risky Skirmish:** Marcus (2 dots) charges a cultist. Rolls 4, 3 = 4 (Partial Success).

- **Result:** Defeats the cultist but takes a Risky consequence. GM says he takes a blade to the side. Standard Effect = 3 segments of Physical harm. Marcus has a Physical Harm clock at **3/6**.
  **Round 2 - Desperate Shoot:** Pinned down, Marcus's Position worsens to Desperate. He rolls Shoot (1 dot): gets a 2 (Failure).
- **Result:** GM says the cultist fire catches him fully exposed. Desperate Position + Standard Effect = 5 segments. Marcus's Physical Harm clock jumps to **8/6 = 6/6 (Dying)**.
  **Stabilization:** Elena uses her turn to drag Marcus to cover and apply a stimpack. She rolls a 3 (failure), but even a failed attempt counts as stabilization. Marcus is stable but at 6/6.
  **Between Missions:** After the next Momentum Reset, Marcus's 6/6 Physical clock automatically reduces to 5/6. He can also take a Downtime recovery action.
  **If Marcus Deploys Again:** If Marcus goes on another mission at 6/6 Physical:
- His Position worsens on relevant actions (running, fighting, anything physical)
- If he takes Risky Physical harm, he's dying again
- If he takes Desperate Physical harm, he's **instantly dead** - no chance for rescue

## CONSUMABLES & DEPLETION

**Situation:** Sofia has frag grenades (Common, 8-segment depletion clock currently at 3/8).
**Action:** Sofia uses a grenade against clustered cultists. Rolls Shoot with Great Effect - devastates them.
**Depletion Roll:** After use, Sofia rolls 1d6 for depletion: gets a 5. Clock advances from 3/8 to **8/8 (Filled)**.
**Consequence:** 

- Frag grenades drop from Accessible to Inaccessible tier for the **entire team**
- Everyone's frag grenade clocks freeze at their current count
- Future grenade use requires 1 Momentum flashback + relevant Trait per use
- The team's supply line is cut until restored narratively (finding a cache, resupply mission, etc.)
  **Example of Continued Use:** Later, Kai wants grenades. He spends 1 Momentum for a flashback: "My 'Astra Militarum Veteran' Trait means I always keep a few extra in my kit." He gets one use. He'll need another flashback for the next one.
