# FORGED IN THE GRIMDARK
## TRAIT PRIMER

Traits are descriptive tags that justify mechanical advantages. This guide helps you create traits for character creation and during play.

---

## WHAT MAKES A GOOD TRAIT

A trait describes experiences, roles, or origins - not stats or abilities. Good traits:

- **Work in multiple contexts** - Broad enough to apply often, or narrow enough to be powerful when relevant
- **Suggest capabilities** - Imply what you can do without prescribing mechanics
- **Tell a story** - Reveal who your character is through what they've done or where they're from

**Examples:**
- "Astra Militarum Veteran" (broad, many applications)
- "Survivor of Hive Bottom" (specific origin, flexible use)
- "Witnessed the Immaterium" (narrow experience, powerful when relevant)

## GROUPED TRAITS

**Note:** Faction/role pairings show common examples, not rigid constraints. Mix freely based on your character concept.

Use these faction/role trees as foundations. Faction-level actions apply to all roles beneath them. Add role-specific actions to create your trait.
