#  FORGED IN THE GRIMDARK
### **THE COMPLETE PLAYER PRIMER**

This is a collaborative storytelling game. You describe what your character does, and the Game Master (GM) will tell you which of the 12 Actions to roll. The core of the game is taking risks to gain **Momentum**, a shared resource your team spends to overcome impossible odds.

---

## CHARACTER CREATION

- **Traits:** Begin with two starting Traits. Frame them as experiences from your past:
  1. One **Role** Trait (e.g., Served with Elite Infantry Regiment, Fled Imprisonment as Rogue Psyker).
  2. One **Background** Trait (e.g., Survived City Underbelly Gang Wars, Washout from Military Academy).

- **Actions:** You have 12 total dots to distribute across the 12 Actions, with a maximum of 3 dots in any single Action at character creation. You can have 0 dots in some Actions.

- **Equipment:** Choose your starting equipment based on your Traits.

---

## CORE CONCEPTS

- **Shared Momentum Pool:** A collaborative resource for the whole team, capped at 10. Momentum generated beyond the cap is lost. Sessions begin at 5 Momentum. The game is designed to naturally oscillate between high and low Momentum.

- **Trait-Based Characters:** Progression comes from acquiring descriptive traits, not raising stats.

- **Simplified Mechanics:** The 12 core actions are your only stats.

- **Homeostatic Economy:** The Momentum system self-corrects toward equilibrium around 5 Momentum through spending (pushes, flashbacks) and generation (accepting consequences). This creates natural oscillation, not death spiral.

---

## THE MOMENTUM SYSTEM

#### **Spending Momentum**

- **Push Yourself (1 Momentum):** Add +1d to a roll OR improve its Effect by one level: Limited to Standard, or Standard to Great (declare before rolling and explain how you're doing it).

- **Flashback (1 Momentum):** Reveal prior preparation that grants a mechanical advantage. This requires a relevant Trait (you can establish a new Trait through this flashback), cannot contradict facts already established in the fiction, and must respond to an immediate challenge or situation. Mechanical advantages include: improving Position or Effect, enabling new approaches, justifying equipment access, or taking actions that influence rolls. (Narrative flashbacks that don't influence Position, Effect, or available actions cost 0 Momentum).

#### **Generating Momentum**

**From Accepting Consequences:**
- **Desperate** Consequence: **+4 Momentum**
- **Risky** Consequence: **+2 Momentum**
- **Controlled** Consequence: **+1 Momentum**

**From Leaning into a Trait (Player-Driven):**
Describe how your Trait creates a complication. **The team gains 2 Momentum**, and that Trait is disabled (physically mark it as checked off on your character sheet) until the next Momentum Reset. While disabled, you cannot use it to improve Position/Effect or justify Flashbacks.

#### **The Momentum Reset**

A Reset marks the end of a dramatic "act," setting the team's Momentum to **5**. An "act" is the period between Resets and may span multiple scenes.

- **GM-Initiated:** The GM can propose a reset after a major objective is met - typically an event with risks and stakes that ends in a period of safety, relaxation, or respite.

- **Player-Initiated:** The team can request a reset. The GM then frames a final **"Reset Objective"**--a short, dramatic challenge that must be overcome to earn it.

**Reset Frequency Options:**
- **Frequent (3-5 per session):** After each major encounter--fast-paced, episodic feel
- **Moderate (1-2 per session):** After mission objectives complete--longer pressure arcs
- **Rare (1 per multiple sessions):** Only at major story beats--extended tension

## LOW MOMENTUM RECOVERY (0-3 MOMENTUM ONLY)

#### **Rally**

A character can initiate a **flashback** where they reference a teammate's Trait to inspire the group. The referenced teammate must be present. This social action is **always in a Controlled position.**

- **Momentum Gain:** **1-4 Momentum**, based on your roll result (1-3: 1 Momentum, 4-5: 2 Momentum, 6: 3 Momentum, Critical: 4 Momentum). Consequences from Rally are reduced effect (gaining less Momentum) rather than harm or complications.

- **Critical Success:** On a critical (two 6s), you can also improve one or all teammates' Position by one step on their next roll.

- **Re-Enable Trait:** If there is a disabled Trait (yours or a teammate's), you may re-enable it as part of the Rally.

- **Availability:** Only usable at 0-3 Momentum. Each character has one Rally per Reset (check it off when used).

#### **Stims**

A last-resort measure for desperate situations. Once per action, you may use Stims on **your own roll** after seeing the result to reroll it.

- **Mechanics:** After rerolling, roll a d6 and advance your 8-segment **Addiction Clock** by that much.

- **Addiction:** When your clock fills, you gain the "Addict" Trait, and Stims become **Inaccessible for the entire team**.

- **Recovery:** The Addiction Clock reduces by 2 segments after a Momentum Reset.

## CORE MECHANICS

#### **Actions & Rolls**

Roll a number of d6s equal to your Action rating (if zero, roll 2d6 and take the lowest).

| ACTION       | DESCRIPTION                                                                 |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shoot**    | Attack at a distance with ranged weapons.                                   |
| **Skirmish** | Engage in close-quarters combat, both armed and unarmed.                    |
| **Skulk**    | Move unseen, unheard, or follow a target without being noticed.             |
| **Wreck**    | Apply brute force to destroy an obstacle or create chaos.                   |
| **Finesse**  | Use careful, precise movements, like picking a lock or disarming a trap.    |
| **Survey**   | Observe your surroundings to spot details or understand a situation.        |
| **Study**    | Scrutinize details, research lore, or analyze a person or object.           |
| **Tech**     | Interact with, repair, or bypass technology and machine spirits.            |
| **Attune**   | Sense the unnatural energies of the immaterium, corruption, or psychic phenomena. |
| **Command**  | Compel obedience or inspire action through authority and intimidation.      |
| **Consort**  | Socialize, build relationships, and navigate social situations.             |
| **Sway**     | Persuade, deceive, or manipulate others through charm and lies.             |

**Roll Results:**
- **1-3 (Failure):** You face consequences based on your Position and gain Momentum (+1 Controlled, +2 Risky, +4 Desperate).
- **4-5 (Partial Success):** You succeed, but face consequences based on your Position and gain Momentum (+1 Controlled, +2 Risky, +4 Desperate).
- **6 (Full Success):** You succeed without complication.
- **Critical (Two 6s):** You achieve exceptional success--your Effect is increased by one level, and you gain some additional advantage or benefit.

#### **Position & Effect**

- **Position** determines the severity of consequences: **Controlled, Risky, or Desperate**. Risky is the default. Controlled is earned through advantages (good gear, traits, tactical superiority). Desperate is typically a consequence of failure - when things go badly, your Position worsens. Position is determined through conversation between the GM and player, based on your approach and the situation. You can improve it by changing tactics or gaining advantages in the fiction.

- **Effect** determines the impact of success: **Limited, Standard, or Great**. Standard is the default. Effect is determined through conversation between the GM and player, based on factors like the quality and tier of your gear, the scale of your action, relevant traits, and your approach. You can improve Effect by gaining advantages or by Pushing Yourself.

#### **Teamwork**

- **Assist:** Help a teammate by making your own action roll. If you succeed (4-6), they get +1d to their roll. You face consequences from your own roll, and they face consequences from theirs--each of you is independently exposed to risk based on your own Position and result.

- **Protect:** Step in to take a consequence meant for a teammate. You suffer the exact consequence they would have taken.

- **Lead a Group Action:** When multiple people act together, one person leads. Everyone involved makes their own roll. The group uses the leader's result as the outcome. However, the leader takes 1 harm segment for each teammate who rolls a failure (1-3). The GM determines which clock(s) are appropriate based on the fiction and the conversation.

---

## HARM & RECOVERY

#### **Consequence Clocks**

Harm is tracked on 6-segment **clocks**. Clocks track a specific type of harm (e.g., Physical Harm, Shaken Morale, Psychic Corruption). Segments are filled based on the action's **Position and Effect.**

Characters can have up to three active harm clocks. If you would take a fourth type of harm, it replaces the clock with the fewest segments--the segments remain, but the harm type changes to reflect the new threat.

| Position   | Limited Effect | Standard Effect | Great Effect       |
| ---------- | -------------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Controlled | 0 segments     | 1 segment       | 2 segments         |
| Risky      | 2 segments     | 3 segments      | 4 segments         |
| Desperate  | 4 segments     | 5 segments      | 6 segments (Dying) |

#### **Dying & Defeat**

- At **6/6** on a harm clock, you are dying. The team takes turns clockwise. Before your next turn comes around, someone must attempt to stabilize you by taking an action to help (medical aid, inspiring words, pulling you to safety). Even a failed attempt counts as stabilization. If no one attempts stabilization before your turn, you are removed from the game.

- If not stabilized, you choose your fate: Death, Captured, or Lost.

#### **Fighting Wounded**

- **Wounded (1-5/6):** The GM can worsen your Position on actions relevant to that harm type, based on how the injury would affect your capabilities in the fiction.

- **Critical (6/6, Stabilized):** If you deploy on a mission, your Position worsens on relevant actions.
  - **High Stakes:** The risks are immense. Taking **Risky** harm to that same clock makes you dying again. Taking **Desperate** harm to that clock is **instant death--no chance for rescue.

#### **Recovery**

- **Between Missions:** After a Momentum Reset, any 6/6 clocks reduce to 5/6.

- **Downtime:** After a Momentum Reset, you can take a recovery action using any relevant Action based on your approach (meditation, medical treatment, talking it out, etc.). Describe how you're recovering and the GM will determine which Action to roll. This is always a Controlled position roll. Success clears segments based on Effect (1/2/4).

- When a clock is reduced to 0/6 segments (fully cleared), you have a choice: either erase the clock entirely, or convert it into a permanent **Trait** that reflects how the injury shaped you.

## CHARACTER ADVANCEMENT & EQUIPMENT

#### **Action Dots**

At the end of a campaign milestone or other important moment, the GM will grant 1 dot to distribute freely. The maximum dot count on an action is 4.

#### **Traits**

**Traits** are specific experiences from your past. To use a trait, explain how it grants you relevant capabilities, knowledge, or advantages for your current action. Through conversation with the GM, this may improve your **Position** or **Effect**. You can also use traits to justify **Flashbacks** or create complications via **Leaning into a Trait**. Use one trait per roll. Your character grows by acquiring new Traits, not by increasing stats.

#### **Acquiring New Traits**

You can gain new Traits in two ways:

1. **Through Flashbacks:** Spend 1 Momentum to establish a past experience. Name a specific event, place, person, or unit from that experience - this becomes your new permanent Trait. You can immediately use it to justify the flashback's mechanical advantage.

2. **From Scars:** When you fully heal a harm clock, you can convert it into a permanent Trait. Frame it as the experience or knowledge gained from enduring that harm.

#### **Grouping Traits**

Between sessions or after a Momentum Reset, you may consolidate three similar traits into a single broader one. The three original traits are consumed. The GM approves the grouped trait's scope and phrasing.

#### **Equipment Tiers**

- **Accessible:** Standard gear for your role. Declare freely.

- **Inaccessible:** Specialized gear. Requires a **1 Momentum Flashback** justified by a Trait. You can establish a new Trait through this flashback to justify the gear access, gaining both the permanent Trait and the equipment.

- **Epic:** Legendary gear. Must be earned as a story reward and cannot be acquired through flashbacks.

#### **Consumables (Grenades, Stims, etc.)**

Limited-use items are tracked with **depletion clocks**.

- **Acquisition:** Gain access via flashbacks, sometimes referencing a teammate's trait to justify it.

- **Usage:** After each use (even on a failed roll), roll a d6 and advance that item's clock by the result.

- **Depletion:** Clock size depends on rarity: **Common (8)**, **Uncommon (6)**, or **Rare (4)**.

- **When Any Clock Fills:** That item's **availability drops one tier** for the entire team. Accessible items become Inaccessible, requiring a 1 Momentum flashback + Trait per use. Everyone else's clock for that item freezes at its current count. The filled clock remains filled--no further degradation occurs. Availability is restored only through the story.

## PLAYTEST QUESTIONS

These design questions need observation during actual play:

- **Trait Cap:** What's a reasonable maximum number of Traits per character to prevent bloat?
- **Momentum Homeostasis:** Does the system naturally oscillate around 5 Momentum as designed?
- **Rally Frequency:** How often do teams actually drop to 0-3 Momentum and use Rally?
- **Reset Cadence:** Which reset frequency (frequent/moderate/rare) creates the best tension and pacing?
