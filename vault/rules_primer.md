#  FORGED IN THE GRIMDARK
### **THE COMPLETE PLAYER PRIMER**

This is a collaborative storytelling game. You describe what your character does, and the Game Master (GM) will tell you which of the 12 Actions to roll. The core of the game is taking risks to gain **Momentum**, a shared resource your team spends to overcome impossible odds.

---

## CHARACTER CREATION

- **Traits:** Begin with two starting Traits. Frame them as experiences from your past:
  1. One **Role** Trait (e.g., Served with Elite Infantry Regiment, Fled Imprisonment as Rogue Psyker).
  2. One **Background** Trait (e.g., Survived City Underbelly Gang Wars, Washout from Military Academy).

- **Approaches:** You have **5 dots** to distribute across the four Approaches (**Force, Guile, Focus, Spirit**).
  - The maximum rating in any Approach is **2** at character creation.
  - You may have 0 dots in an Approach.

- **Equipment:** Choose your starting equipment based on your Traits.

---

## CORE CONCEPTS

- **Shared Momentum Pool:** A collaborative resource for the whole team, capped at 10. Momentum generated beyond the cap is lost. Sessions begin at 5 Momentum. The game is designed to naturally oscillate between high and low Momentum.

- **Trait-Based Characters:** Progression comes from acquiring descriptive traits, not raising stats.

- **Simplified Mechanics:** The 12 core actions are your only stats.

- **Homeostatic Economy:** The Momentum system self-corrects toward equilibrium around 5 Momentum through spending (pushes, flashbacks) and generation (accepting consequences). This creates natural oscillation, not death spiral.

---

## THE MOMENTUM SYSTEM

#### **Spending Momentum**

- **Push Yourself (1 Momentum):** Add +1d to a roll OR improve its Effect by one level: Limited to Standard, Standard to Great, or Great to Spectacular (declare before rolling and explain how you're doing it).

- **Flashback (1 Momentum):** Reveal prior preparation that grants a mechanical advantage. This requires a relevant Trait - you can use an existing trait OR establish a new trait through this flashback. The flashback cannot contradict facts already established in the fiction, and must respond to an immediate challenge or situation. Mechanical advantages include: improving Position by one step (Impossible→Desperate, Desperate→Risky, or Risky→Controlled), improving Effect, enabling new approaches, justifying equipment access, or taking actions that influence rolls. (Narrative use of traits that don't influence Position, Effect, or available actions cost 0 Momentum).

#### **Generating Momentum**

**From Accepting Consequences:**
- **Impossible** Consequence: **+6 Momentum**
- **Desperate** Consequence: **+4 Momentum**
- **Risky** Consequence: **+2 Momentum**
- **Controlled** Consequence: **+1 Momentum**

**From Leaning into a Trait (Player-Driven):**
Describe how your Trait creates a complication. **The team gains 2 Momentum**, and that Trait is disabled (physically mark it as checked off on your character sheet) until the next Momentum Reset. While disabled, you cannot use it to improve Position/Effect or justify Flashbacks.

#### **The Momentum Reset**

A Reset marks the end of a dramatic "act," setting the team's Momentum to **5**. An "act" is the period between Resets and may span multiple scenes.

- **GM-Initiated:** The GM can propose a reset after a major objective is met - typically an event with risks and stakes that ends in a period of safety, relaxation, or respite.

- **Player-Initiated:** The team can request a reset. The GM then frames a final **"Reset Objective"**--a short, dramatic challenge that must be overcome to earn it.

**Reset Frequency Options:**
- **Frequent (3-5 per session):** After each major encounter--fast-paced, episodic feel
- **Moderate (1-2 per session):** After mission objectives complete--longer pressure arcs
- **Rare (1 per multiple sessions):** Only at major story beats--extended tension

**Automatic Clock Recovery:**
All active clocks (Harm, Addiction, and Consumable) automatically recover during a Momentum Reset:
- **Full clocks** (6/6, 8/8, etc.) reduce by 1 segment
- **Partial clocks** reduce by 2 segments (minimum 0)
- **Empty clocks** (0 segments) are removed entirely

---

## LOW MOMENTUM RECOVERY (0-3 MOMENTUM ONLY)

#### **Rally**

A character can initiate a **flashback** where they reference a teammate's Trait to inspire the group. The referenced teammate must be present. This social action uses **Spirit + Guile** and is **always in a Controlled position.**

- **Momentum Gain:** **1-4 Momentum**, based on your roll result (1-3: 1 Momentum, 4-5: 2 Momentum, 6: 3 Momentum, Critical: 4 Momentum). Consequences from Rally are reduced effect (gaining less Momentum) rather than harm or complications.

- **Critical Success:** On a critical (two 6s), you can also improve one or all teammates' Position by one step on their next roll.

- **Re-Enable Trait:** If there is a disabled Trait (yours or a teammate's), you may re-enable it as part of the Rally.

- **Availability:** Only usable at 0-3 Momentum. Each character has one Rally per Reset (check it off when used).

#### **Stims**

A last-resort measure for desperate situations. Once per action, you may use Stims on **your own roll** after seeing the result to reroll it.

- **Mechanics:** After rerolling, roll a d6 and advance your 8-segment **Addiction Clock** by that much.

- **Addiction:** When your clock fills, you gain the "Addict" Trait, and Stims become **Inaccessible for the entire team**.

- **Recovery:** After a Momentum Reset:
  - If your Addiction Clock is full (8/8), it reduces to 7/8.
  - If your Addiction Clock is not full, it reduces by 2 segments (minimum 0).
  - If your Addiction Clock reaches 0, it is removed entirely.

## CORE MECHANICS

#### **Approaches & Rolls**

Instead of specific skills, characters rely on four core **Approaches**. When you face a challenge, describe your goal and choose the Approach that best fits your method.

**The Dice Pool:**
The dice you roll depend on whether you are using a specific tool for the job.

- **With Equipment:** Roll **[Approach Rating] + 1d**.
  *(Requirement: You must have a relevant item in an Inventory Slot to gain this bonus).*

- **Empty-Handed (Synergy):** Roll **[Primary Approach] + [Secondary Approach]**.
  *(Use this when you have no gear or choose to rely solely on innate ability. GM approval required for the combination).*

- **Zero Floor:** If your total pool is 0 dice, roll **2d6 and take the lowest**.

**The Four Approaches:**

| APPROACH | DESCRIPTION |
| :--- | :--- |
| **FORCE** | **Overpowering.** Violence, athletics, intimidation, heavy lifting. |
| **GUILE** | **Indirect.** Stealth, speed, deception, dexterity. |
| **FOCUS** | **Calculated.** Precision, technology, observation, medicine, shooting. |
| **SPIRIT** | **Internal.** Willpower, command, charm, psychic attunement. |

**Roll Results:**
- **1-3 (Failure):** You face consequences based on your Position and gain Momentum (+1 Controlled, +2 Risky, +4 Desperate, +6 Impossible).
- **4-5 (Partial Success):** You succeed, but face consequences based on your Position and gain Momentum (+1 Controlled, +2 Risky, +4 Desperate, +6 Impossible).
- **6 (Full Success):** You succeed without complication.
- **Critical (Two 6s):** You achieve exceptional success--your Effect is increased by one level, and you gain some additional advantage or benefit.

#### **Position & Effect**

- **Position** determines the severity of consequences: **Controlled, Risky, Desperate, or Impossible**. Risky is the default. Controlled is earned through advantages (good gear, traits, tactical superiority). Desperate is typically a consequence of failure - when things go badly, your Position worsens. Impossible represents the most extreme and dire circumstances, where failure means devastating consequences. Position is determined through conversation between the GM and player, based on your approach and the situation. You can improve it by changing tactics or gaining advantages in the fiction.

- **Effect** determines the impact of success: **Limited, Standard, Great, or Spectacular**. Standard is the default. Effect is determined through conversation between the GM and player, based on factors like the quality and tier of your gear, the scale of your action, relevant traits, and your approach. You can improve Effect by gaining advantages or by Pushing Yourself. Spectacular Effect represents extraordinary circumstances where your success has exceptional impact. **Effect only applies when you succeed** - it determines how much progress you make on success clocks (obstacles, objectives, etc.). It does not modify harm or other consequences from failure or partial success.

#### **Teamwork**

- **Assist:** Help a teammate by making your own action roll. If you succeed (4-6), they get +1d to their roll. You face consequences from your own roll, and they face consequences from theirs--each of you is independently exposed to risk based on your own Position and result.

- **Protect:** Step in to take a consequence meant for a teammate. You suffer the exact consequence they would have taken.

- **Lead a Group Action:** When multiple people act together, one person leads. Everyone involved makes their own roll. The group uses the leader's result as the outcome. However, the leader takes 1 harm segment for each teammate who rolls a failure (1-3). The GM determines which clock(s) are appropriate based on the fiction and the conversation.

---

## HARM & RECOVERY

#### **Consequence Clocks**

Harm is tracked on 6-segment **clocks**. Clocks track a specific type of harm (e.g., Physical Harm, Shaken Morale, Psychic Corruption). Segments are filled based on the action's **Position only** (Effect does not apply to consequences).

Characters can have up to three active harm clocks. If you would take a fourth type of harm, it replaces the clock with the fewest segments--the segments remain, but the harm type changes to reflect the new threat.

**Harm Severity (by Position):**

| Position   | Segments |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Controlled | 1        |
| Risky      | 2        |
| Desperate  | 4        |
| Impossible | 6        |

**Note:** Impossible position fills a harm clock completely (6/6), putting the character in a dying state immediately. Effect modifiers (Limited/Standard/Great/Spectacular) apply only to **success clocks** (progress you make when succeeding), not to harm or other consequence clocks.

#### **Dying & Defeat**

- At **6/6** on a harm clock, you are dying. The team takes turns clockwise. Before your next turn comes around, someone must attempt to stabilize you by taking an action to help (medical aid, inspiring words, pulling you to safety). Even a failed attempt counts as stabilization. If no one attempts stabilization before your turn, you are removed from the game.

- If not stabilized, you choose your fate: Death, Captured, or Lost.

#### **Fighting Wounded**

- **Wounded (1-5/6):** The GM can worsen your Position on actions relevant to that harm type, based on how the injury would affect your capabilities in the fiction.

- **Critical (6/6, Stabilized):** If you deploy on a mission, your Position worsens on relevant actions.
  - **High Stakes:** The risks are immense. Taking **Risky** harm to that same clock makes you dying again. Taking **Desperate** harm to that clock is **instant death--no chance for rescue.

#### **Recovery**

- **Automatic (Momentum Reset):** After a Momentum Reset, all harm clocks automatically recover:
  - If a harm clock is full (6/6), it reduces to 5/6.
  - If a harm clock is not full, it reduces by 2 segments (minimum 0).
  - If a harm clock reaches 0, it is removed entirely.

- **Downtime (After Reset):** You can also take a recovery action using any relevant Action based on your approach (meditation, medical treatment, talking it out, etc.). Describe how you're recovering and the GM will determine which Action to roll. This is always a Controlled position roll. Success clears segments based on Effect (1/2/4). If a clock is reduced to 0 through downtime recovery, it is removed entirely.

#### **Success Clocks (Progress Tracking)**

When you succeed at an action that makes progress toward a goal (picking a lock, hacking a system, convincing a group, building a device), you advance a **success clock**. Unlike harm/consequence clocks, success clocks are affected by both Position and Effect:

**Progress on Success (Position + Effect):**
- **Base Progress:** Controlled=1, Risky=3, Desperate=5, Impossible=6 segments
- **Effect Modifier:** Limited=-1, Standard=+0, Great=+1, Spectacular=+2

Example: A Risky action with Great Effect would advance 4 segments (3 base + 1 for great effect). A Desperate action with Spectacular Effect would advance 7 segments (5 base + 2 for spectacular effect).

## CHARACTER ADVANCEMENT & EQUIPMENT

#### **Action Dots**

At the end of a campaign milestone or other important moment, the GM will grant 1 dot to distribute freely. The maximum dot count on an action is 4.

#### **Traits**

**Traits** are specific experiences from your past. To use a trait for narrative flavor (describing how your background influences your approach), there is no cost. To gain a mechanical advantage (improving **Position** by one step: Desperate→Risky or Risky→Controlled, or improving **Effect**), you must spend 1 Momentum for a **Flashback** using that trait. You can also use traits to create complications via **Leaning into a Trait**. Use one trait per roll. Your character grows by acquiring new Traits, not by increasing stats.

#### **Acquiring New Traits**

You can gain new Traits in two ways:

1. **Through Flashbacks:** Spend 1 Momentum to establish a past experience. Name a specific event, place, person, or unit from that experience - this becomes your new permanent Trait. You can immediately use it to justify the flashback's mechanical advantage.

2. **From Scars:** When you fully heal a harm clock, you can convert it into a permanent Trait. Frame it as the experience or knowledge gained from enduring that harm.

#### **Grouping Traits**

You may consolidate three similar traits into a single broader one in two situations:

1. **Between sessions or after a Momentum Reset:** Freely consolidate three traits. The GM approves the grouped trait's scope and phrasing.

2. **During a Flashback (1 Momentum):** If you have the fewest traits among your crew (or tied for fewest), you may consolidate three traits into one broader trait as part of a flashback action. This costs 1 Momentum total (the flashback cost). The three original traits are consumed, and you may immediately use the new consolidated trait to improve Position or Effect. Role and background traits cannot be consolidated.

#### **Equipment Tiers**

- **Accessible:** Standard gear for your role. Declare freely.

- **Inaccessible:** Specialized gear. Requires a **1 Momentum Flashback** justified by a Trait. You can establish a new Trait through this flashback to justify the gear access, gaining both the permanent Trait and the equipment.

- **Epic:** Legendary gear. Must be earned as a story reward and cannot be acquired through flashbacks.

#### **Consumables (Grenades, Stims, etc.)**

Limited-use items are tracked with **depletion clocks**.

- **Acquisition:** Gain access via flashbacks, sometimes referencing a teammate's trait to justify it.

- **Usage:** After each use (even on a failed roll), roll a d6 and advance that item's clock by the result.

- **Depletion:** Clock size depends on rarity: **Common (8)**, **Uncommon (6)**, or **Rare (4)**.

- **When Any Clock Fills:** That item's **availability drops one tier** for the entire team. Accessible items become Inaccessible, requiring a 1 Momentum flashback + Trait per use. Everyone else's clock for that item freezes at its current count. The filled clock remains filled--no further degradation occurs. Availability is restored only through the story.
